			<td><p align="justify">What adventure would be complete without a worthy foe to battle? Not this one, that's for sure! Our team has always loved the Deerclops in our plays of Don't Starve Together, so we immediately gravitated towards adding it as our featured boss battle for this crossover. We targeted this boss for mid/late Pre-Hardmode so that it would be accessible to as many players as possible. Make sure you check out his super-cool theme music - provided by Klei themsevles and inspired from Deerclops' theme in Don't Starve! You can summon this terrifying foe in the cold climate of the Ice Biome. What awaits you in this fight? Well... you will have to wait and see for yourselves!</p>
			<p align="justify">What Terraria update would be complete without an array of new items to discover and use? We have added over 25 items lifted from or inspired by Don't Starve Together content. These range from new pets to weapons to vanity and more! These can drop on any world, but players will find a higher drop rate on worlds using the DST "The Constant" seed!</p><p align="justify">Somewhere in the game world, survivors may come across the mysterious Terrarium setpiece which will allow players to encounter the Eye of Terror boss, (Terraria's Eye of Cthulu - as seen through the lens of the Constant) complete with its own Terraria inspired theme music. For our seasoned survivors, the Twins of Terror can be summoned for an added challenge. Each boss has its own unique eye-catching equipment item, and we've also added new statues of these bosses to show off your triumphs.</p><td>

			<td><p align="justify">erraria is teeming with life - both friend and foe - that you will encounter on your expiditions. Nefarious armies, warring factions, and epic bosses lurk in the shadows as well...seeking to tear you limb from limb. If that wasn't enough, it seems as if the very moon has set itself against you! Fortunately, you are blessed with a vast and diverse arsenal of ways to defend yourself! From swords to sorcery to firearms to cleverly-designed traps and beyond: Terraria embraces the notion of combat on your terms, no matter the playstyle! Take up arms and show the enemy hordes who's boss!</p><p align="justify">
			Who made all of this anyway?  At long last, Terraria on PC has it's own credits! Upon defeating the Moon Lord for the first time, be sure to stay tuned for an awesome throwback credit sequence, including an exclusive never-before-heard music track!  Want to see it again?  You can access the Credits from the main menu at any time. The Music Box (Journey's End) is now created by recording the Credits music sequence. Additionally, using it in a normal accessory slot will play the Credits sequence in-game, while using it in a social slot will only play the music.</p></td>
