	<p align="justify">Greetings Terrarians!</p>
	<p align="justify">Spooky season is finally upon us! We hope that your pumpkin carving, candy collecting, haunted house visiting, and trick or treat preparations have been going quite well. On our end, we have loved seeing the Halloween Contest entries coming in (over 300 entries and counting - you still have time to get your amazing Pumpkins, Costumes, and more in!) while we continue to work away on 1.4.5. We are also getting really excited to see some of the other Terraria things that will be coming out over the Holidays, such as the next wave of the Terraria Graphic Novel, new merch stuff, and more. It is also the time of the year where we really start to reflect on how much we appreciate each and every one of you and your support. We will say it again (probably more than once) - thank you so much for all that you do for us!</p>
	<p align="justify">That said, let's go door to door for the latest Terraria treats - no tricks, we promise!</p>
