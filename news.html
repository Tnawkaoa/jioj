	<h1>Terraria 1.4.3.3 - Steam Deck Optimization Update!</h1>
	<img src="iklan1.png" align="center">
	<p align="justify">As we have mentioned over the past few months, the team has been hard at work on an update to further optimize Terraria for Steam Deck play - inclusive of performance and controls. With the Steam Deck officially shipping out to players starting today, we are pleased to be able to push this update out to everyone just in time! For Terrarians that are not playing on Steam Deck at this time, dont fret, as we have some quality of life, balance, and bug fixes for you as well. Without further ado, let's dive right in!
	Please note that this update also includes an update to the Terraria Dedicated Server application. You can always find the latest version of this at the bottom of Terraria.org, but we have included a link below for today's version as well:</p>
